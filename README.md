# BBQ Master Webinar Landing Page

## Overview

This project is a simple, responsive **landing page** designed to promote a live BBQ webinar. It highlights the event, encourages sign-ups, and collects participant details through a registration form. The layout is clean and modern, using Google Fonts for typography and an external stylesheet for styling.

## Features

* **Intro Section**: Engaging headline with a strong callout about BBQ ribs.
* **Event Highlight**: Subtitle emphasizing that it’s a live webinar.
* **Main Content**:

  * Persuasive copy describing why the webinar is valuable.
  * Registration form for users to sign up with their name and email.
  * Privacy note reassuring users their data is safe.
* **Responsive Design**: Meta viewport ensures it adapts to different devices.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Page structure and semantic markup.
* **CSS (external styles.css)** – Styling, layout, and responsiveness.
* **Google Fonts (Source Sans Pro)** – Custom typography.

## How It Works

1. The **intro section** grabs attention with bold typography and event details.
2. The **main section** explains the event and contains a form for user registration.
3. The **form** requires a name and email before submission.
4. The **privacy statement** ensures user trust.

## Customization

* Update **`styles.css`** to change colors, layout, or font sizes.
* Replace the **webinar details** (headline, text, and subheadings) with your own.
* Add backend functionality or a service (e.g., Mailchimp, Firebase, or custom API) to handle **form submissions**.

## Deployment

* Can be hosted on **Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel** as a static site.
* Ensure that the **form action** is connected to a backend or mailing list service for full functionality.
